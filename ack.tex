The predecessor of PiP is PVAS (Partitioned Virtual Address Space)
developed by Akio Shimada. The idea of using PIE was his idea. Pavan
Balaji has a great insight and he saw through the possibilities of
PVAS at the first time Akio and I had a meeting with him. He also gave
me some great ideas when developing PiP. The name of PiP was his
recommendation. Min Si devoted her lots of time to help me writing PiP
papers. Kaiming Ouyang wrote great papers to improve MPICH performance
by using 
PiP. Yutaka Ishikawa allowed me to devote most of my time for
developing PiP.  Balazs Gerofi also gave me some useful comments on
PiP. Noriyuki Soda helped me a lot while developing PiP and he developed
the Github actions for testing PiP.

Finally, I thank to my wife, Fusa Hori, allowing me to devote my time
for writing this book.
