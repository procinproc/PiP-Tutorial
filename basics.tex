Let me start describing the PiP basics for those who are not
familiar with PiP; 1) how to run a PiP program, 2) How to write a PiP
program, and 3) usage of PiP commands. The explanations in this
chapter does not go into details. For more details, refer to the 
Chapter~\ref{chap:advanced} and/or the other documents (man pages and
PDF).
