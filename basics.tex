For those who are unfamiliar, let me first go through the fundamentals
of PiP: 1) how to execute a PiP program, 2) how to write a PiP
program, and 3) how to use PiP commands. This chapter's explanations
don't get into specifics. Consult the other publications (man pages
and PDF) or Chapter~\ref{chap:advanced} for further information.
