\section{Execution Context}\label{sec:context}

Before explaining the rest of the arguments, readers should know about
the execution context under PiP. The execution context can be defined
as the state of CPU, i.e., contents of hardware registers. On PiP,
this definition may not be enough. Let us have an example. Suppose
that the same program runs as two PiP tasks and this program has a
function {\tt foo()}. By passing the function pointer, by using the
\pipfunc{pip_named_export()} and \pipfunc{pip_named_import()}, one of
the PiP task can call the function of the other PiP
task. Additionally, this function accesses a static variable, say {\tt
  var}. If task $A$ calls function {\tt foo} of task $B$, then the
called function accesses the variable owned by task $B$, not $A$
(Listing~\ref{prg:context} and \ref{out:context}).

\lstinputlisting[style=program,
  caption={Function Call of Another Task},
  label=prg:context] {context/examples/context.c}

In this example program, sorry, this may go off the side road,
\pipfunc{pip_named_export()} and 
\pipfunc{pip_named_import()} are called differently than
before. The second argument of \pipfunc{pip_named_export()} and the
third argument of \pipfunc{pip_named_import()} are actually a format
string, just like {\tt printf()}, followed by argument(s) needed by
the format.

  caption={Function Call of Another Task - Execution}, label=out:context]
                {context/examples/context.out}

Thus, the execution context in PiP environment might be different from
the one in common sense and some times its behavior becomes very
subtle. In the PiP library, this happens quite often and makes
debugging quite difficult. 

Further, the association of static variables and function addresses
heavily depends on the CPU architecture and how PIE is
implemented. The above description is true on \AMD\ and \ARM,
however, not true on \INTEL. Thus, it is not recommended to
do this. 

\subsubsection*{Rationale}

Some readers may wonder why this happens. Let me explain this. This
trick is hidden in the address map. Listing~\ref{out:glibc-segs} shows
a part of address map running three tasks, focusing on the Glibc ({\tt
  /lib64/libc-2.28.so}) segments.

\end{lstlisting}

There are three sets of Glibc segments. The static variables are
located on the last (readable and writable) segment of each set. A
static variable is accessed by an instruction using the offset from
the instruction (program counter relative addressing mode) to the
variable. Thus, the gap size between the code segment (top of the set)
and variable segment (bottom of the set) is important to make all
offsets constant and thus all gap sizes must be the same. In this way,
variables and instructions are associated in \PIE\footnote{This is
not the case if not compiled as \PIE.}, and \PIE\ programs and shared
objects compiled with the \PIC\ option can be loaded at any locations.

Unfortunately, this addressing mode is not supported by all CPU
architectures\footnote{Listing~\ref{out:context} is obtained by
running the program on an \AMD\ CPU.}. For example, \INTEL\  
does not. On this architecture, one general purpose
register is sacrificed to point the variable segment, resulting
performance degradation by loosing one general purpose register. And
the program shown in Listing~\ref{prg:context} exhibits differently.
