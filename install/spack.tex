\section{Using Spack}

Spack\footnote{\url{https://spack.io}} is another installation tool
designed for the HPC software packages and PiP can also be installed
by using Spack. Listing~\ref{out:spack} shows the example of
installing PiP (including PiP-glibc)\footnote{Unfortunately, the
current version does not install PiP-gdb for some reason.}.
