In this section, other features, not described so far, of
\pipfunc{pip_spawn()} and \pipfunc{pip_task_spawn()} will be
explained. For convenience, the function prototypes of these functions
are shown below;

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tb]
int pip_task_spawn( pip_spawn_program_t *progp, [IN]
                    uint32_t coreno,            [IN]
		    uint32_t opts,              [IN]
		    int *pipidp,                [IN/OUT]
		    pip_spawn_hook_t *hookp );  [IN]

int pip_spawn( char *filename,                  [IN]
               char **argv,                     [IN]
               char **envv,                     [IN]
	       int coreno,                      [IN]
               int *pipidp,                     [IN/OUT]
	       pip_spawnhook_t before,          [IN]
               pip_spawnhook_t after,           [IN]
               void *hookarg );                 [IN]
\end{lstlisting}

The first argument of \pipfunc{pip_task_spawn()} function is already
described in Section~\ref{sec:spawn-func}. This is structure is to
pack the first three arguments of \pipfunc{pip_spawn()}. 

\subsection{Start Function}

As already shown in Listing~\ref{sec:spawn-func}, these PiP spawn
functions eventually jumps into the start function ({\tt main()} or
user specified one). To enable this, PiP needs to know the address of
the start function. One of the following two conditions must be
met here;

\begin{itemize}
\item the starting function is defined as a global symbol.
\item if the starting function is defined as a local symbol then the
  executable file must not be stripped.
\end{itemize}

As for the {\tt main()} function, the \pipcmd{pipcc} and
\pipcmd{pipfc} compile programs with the {\tt -rdynamic} option to
make the symbol global. As for the user-defined local symbol, PiP
library read the executable file to spawn and tries to find the
starting function by using the ELF information. Unfortunately, the
local symbol information is lost if stripped, and PiP fails to find
the starting function.

\subsection{Stack Size}

The stack size of spawned PiP tasks can be set by the
\pipdef{PIP_STACKSIZE} environment variable. Like the
\linuxenv{OMP_STACKSIZE} environment defined by OpenMP, its value may 
be suffixed by ``{\tt T},'' ``{\tt G},'' ``{\tt M},'' ``{\tt K},'' or
``{\tt B}'' representing the {\it TiB}, {\it GiB}, {\it MiB}, {\it
  KiB}, or{\it Byte} unit, respectively. If no suffix is present,
{\it KiB} is assumed. Unless \pipdef{PIP_STACKSIZE} is
specified, the environment variable \linuxenv{KMP_STACKSIZE},
  \linuxenv{GOMP_STACKSIZE}, or \linuxenv{OMP_STACKSIZE} is also effective
  with the 
priority in this order.  The \linuxenv{KMP_STACKSIZE},
\linuxenv{GOMP_STACKSIZE}, and \linuxenv{OMP_STACKSIZE} also affects the
size of OpenMP threads, however, \pipdef{PIP_STACKSIZE} only affects
the stack size of PiP tasks. 

\subsection{CPU Core Binding}

The {\tt coreno} argument is to bind the spawned PiP task to the
specified CPU core. By default, this is the $N$th core number. If
users want to specify the absolute core number, then the absolute core
number should be {\tt OR}ed with the
\pipdef{PIP_CPUCORE_ABS} flag. If the core numbers are consecutive,
specifying this flag may not affect the core number
specification. This difference is only seen on some CPU architectures
with non-contiguous core numbers (e.g., Fujitsu A64FX).
The {\tt coreno} argument can be \pipdef{PIP_CPUCORE_ASIS} to bind to
the same CPU cores as of the root process calling the spawn function.

\subsection{File Descriptors and Spawn Hooks}\label{sec:hooks}

In the \pipterm{process mode}, file descriptors of the root process
are duplicated and passed to the spawned child in the same way of what
\linuxfunc{fork()} does. In the \pipterm{pthread mode}, files descriptors
are simply shared among PiP root and PiP tasks. 

If the \term{close-on-exec} flag of a file descriptor owned by the root
process is set in \pipterm{process mode}, then the file descriptor is
closed after calling the \pipterm{before hook} described above (if
any), and then jump into the start function.  

The last argument of \pipfunc{pip_task_spawn()} is the structure
packing the last three arguments of \pipfunc{pip_spawn()}. The
\pipstruct{pip_spawn_hook_t} structure can be set by calling
\pipfunc{pip_spawn_hook()} function. Here is the prototype;

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=tb]
void pip_spawn_hook( pip_spawn_hook_t *hook,  [OUT]
		     pip_spawnhook_t before,  [IN]
		     pip_spawnhook_t after,   [IN]
		     void *hookarg ) {        [IN]
typedef int (*pip_spawnhook_t)( void* );
\end{lstlisting}

The {\tt before} function in this structure is called when a
PiP task is created and before calling the start function (e.g.,
{\tt main()}). And the {\tt after} function is called when the PiP
task is about to terminate. Both functions are called with the argument
specified by the {\tt hookarg} to pass any arbitrary data. 

In general, a new process is created by calling \linuxfunc{fork()} and
\linuxfunc{execve()} in Linux/Unix. Here, file descriptors owned by
parent process are passed to the created child. In many cases, those
file descriptors are closed or duplicated and some other settings take
place between the calls of \linuxfunc{fork()} and
\linuxfunc{execve()}. In PiP, however, the task is created by only one
function and there is no chance to do the same settings with the ones
of using {\tt fork\&exec}. These hook functions are provided for this
purpose. Here is an example of these hook functions;  

\lstinputlisting[style=program,
  caption={Before and After Hooks},
  label=prg:hook] {spawn-adv/examples/hook.c}

In this example, FD1 of the root process is duplicated to FD10 by the
\pipterm{before hook}. Then the spawned task write a message via
FD10. Finally, the FD10 is closed by the \pipterm{after hook}
(Listing~\ref{out:const-dest}). 
Note that the execution of those hook functions are called by the root.

  caption={Before and After Hooks - Execution}, label=out:hook]
