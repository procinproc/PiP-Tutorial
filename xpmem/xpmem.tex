As described in Section~\ref{sec:shared-memory-myth}, {\tt
  XPMEM} is known to provide a shared memory model which is more
convenient that the POSIX shared memory. Again, the shared address
space which PiP provides includes the shared memory model which {\tt
  XPMEM} and POSIX shared memory provide. Thus, the same
functionalities of {\tt XPMEM} can also be implemented by using PiP.

The PiP library provides the same functions which are provides by {\tt
  XPMEM}.  Those who have programs using {\tt XPMEM} can easily switch
to using PiP.  By using PiP, there is no need of installing {\tt
  XPMEM} kernel module. Most importantly, {\tt XPMEM} functions
provided by PiP work much faster than those of {\tt XPMEM}. This is
because no system call involved to map memory segment of the other
process(es) in PiP. Indeed, most {\tt XPMEM} functions almost do
nothing since the other processes are already mapped from the
beginning in PiP.
