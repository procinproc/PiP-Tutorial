As stated in Section~\ref{sec:shared-memory-myth}, it is well known
that XPMEM offers a shared memory model that is more practical than
POSIX shared memory. Once more, the shared memory paradigm that XPMEM
and POSIX shared memory offer is included in the shared address space
that PiP offers. 

The identical functions that XPMEM offers are also provided by the PiP
library. Users of XPMEM-based programs can quickly convert to PiP. The
XPMEM kernel module does not need to be installed while using
PiP. Most notably, PiP's XPMEM operations operate far more quickly
than those of XPMEM. This is due to the fact that no system call was
necessary to map the memory segment of the other PiP task(s). In
fact, since PiP has already had the other processes mapped from the
start, the majority of XPMEM routines essentially do nothing.
